## Hello ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub!<br>

Here, you can explore my projects and contributions to various repositories. Feel free to check out my [personal work](https://github.com/H4ppy-04?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) as well as some of my [shared work](https://github.com/H4ppy-04?tab=repositories&q=&type=fork&language=&sort=stargazers) where I've collaborated with other developers. Each repository listed in each of the previous links (hopefully) has a README file[^1].

Iâ€™m excited to share my GitHub as I seek both paid and unpaid internship and work experience opportunities. Feel free to connect!

### About Me

I am a hobbyist software developer from Sydney, Australia. I have been programming for a few years. I am interested in [FOSS](https://freeopensourcesoftware.org//index.php/Main_Page), Python and Rust - particularly how they pertain to game development with frameworks such as [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) and [PyGame](https://pygame.org), computer history, CPU architecture, [kernel and development tools](https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/index.html), [Unix](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org), and general software development.

### My Workflow

I use an [Acer Swift Go](https://www.acer.com/au-en/laptops/swift/swift-go/pdp/NX.KSGSA.004) running [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) as my primary machine, and I store all my files on a file server running on an old [Spin V](https://www.acer.com/ee-en/laptops/spin/spin-5-intel) running NixOS which I just SSH into over my local network. For software development I Vim[^2] inside a [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session. For handling Mail I use [Neomutt](https://neomutt.org/), with my emails stored locally over SSH. When I want to access mail remotely I tend to just use Thunderbird. For file *management* I used [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), then switched to [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), and now I'm trying out [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/). For file *browsing*, just using FZF[^3] seems to be enough 99% of the time. For browsing the web I use Firefox with [UBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/). For viewing PDF's I use [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/). For academic writing and note taking I use a combination of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for typesetting and VimTex[^4] for live reloading Zathura. I use MPV and sometimes VLC for viewing media, and I mainly just use [RhythmBox](http://www.rhythmbox.org/) for listening to podcasts, music, radio, etc since that's the default audio player that comes with Mint. Hardware-wise I route audio through a [Focusrite](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo-3rd-gen) interface and into [ATH MX50](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-au/ath-m50x) headphones.

It is also common for authors include any relevant project information (such as features, roadmaps, issues, install processes, etc).
