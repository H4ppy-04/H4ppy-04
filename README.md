## Hello ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub!<br>

Here, you can explore my projects and contributions to various repositories. Feel free to check out my [personal work](https://github.com/H4ppy-04?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) as well as some of my [shared work](https://github.com/H4ppy-04?tab=repositories&q=&type=fork&language=&sort=stargazers) where I've collaborated with other developers. Each repository listed in each of the previous links (hopefully) has a README file[^1].

Iâ€™m excited to share my GitHub as I seek both paid and unpaid internship and work experience opportunities. Feel free to connect!

### About Me

I am a hobbyist software developer from Sydney, Australia. I have been programming for a few years. I am interested in [FOSS](https://freeopensourcesoftware.org//index.php/Main_Page), Python and Rust - particularly how they pertain to game development with frameworks such as [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) and [PyGame](https://pygame.org), terminal tools, computer history, CPU architecture, [kernel and development tools](https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/index.html), [Unix](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org), and general software development.


Kind Regards,<br>

It is also common for authors include any relevant project information (such as features, roadmaps, issues, install processes, etc).
