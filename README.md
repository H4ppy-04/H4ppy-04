## Interests
 * [FOSS](https://freeopensourcesoftware.org//index.php/Main_Page)
 * Python and Rust
 * How the languages I use pertain to game development
 * Development libraries such as [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) and [PyGame](https://pygame.org)
 * Computer history
 * CPU architecture and CPU history
 * [Linux](https://docs.kernel.org), [Unix](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org)

### My Workflow

 * Machine: [Acer Swift Go](https://www.acer.com/au-en/laptops/swift/swift-go/pdp/NX.KSGSA.004)
 * Primary OS: [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)
 * Secondary machine(s): [Spin V](https://www.acer.com/ee-en/laptops/spin/spin-5-intel) x2 (used as servers running NixOS & Mint)
 * Editor: Neovim inside a [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session and Tmux is managed with Tmuxinator.
 * Mail: [Neomutt](https://neomutt.org/), with my emails stored locally over SSH.
 * File indexing: FZF
 * Browser: Firefox with [UBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/), and Vimium make an awesome combo.
 * For viewing PDF's I use [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/).
 * For academic writing and note taking I use a combination of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for typesetting and Vimtex[^4] for live reloading Zathura.
 * Podcasts: I mainly just use [RhythmBox](http://www.rhythmbox.org/) for listening to podcasts and radio over SSH since that's the default audio player that comes with Mint.
 * Music: Cmus hasn't let me down yet. Mpd and Mpc have been my go-to combo in the past, but right now Cmus is the program I'm using.
 * Audio: I route audio through a [Focusrite](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo-3rd-gen) interface and into [ATH MX50](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-au/ath-m50x) headphones.

[^4]: Vimtex is a plugin for Vim that allows me to live-reload most pdf viewers and run a LaTeX compiler when I save a file.
